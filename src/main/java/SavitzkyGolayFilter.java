/**
 * Implementation of the Savitzky-Golay filter taken from Numerical Recipes in C
 * (chapter 14.8, page 650). This filter smoothes the incoming signal by replacing
 * each value in the series with the value obtained from a polynomial fit on the
 * window around the value with size 2n+1.
 * <p />
 * The Points-enum indicates the possible window-sizes. This has been restricted
 * due to the fact that the algorithm utilizes pre-calculated coefficients. A
 * smaller window-size keeps the signal intact, but removes less noise.
